# Geometric-Deep-Learning
In these three notebooks I am going to show you how to use python to check equivariance, invariance in Graph Neural Network, Message passing, and Graph convolution.

We also tested these properties for molecules under 3D rotation and translation as it appears in lab-GDL-3.

The power of GNN was also tested to differentiate the graphs which are isomorphism.
